If you ever get bored, you can try making 3D models by just writing.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c8c32ab-ef28-4a52-abd2-829895a04c79)

Some instruction:
  Move model around by holidng left mouse button.
  Rotate model by holding right mouse button.
  Press [1] to show/hide vertexes.
  Press [2] to show/hide vertices.
  Press [3] to show/hide faces(polygons).
  Press [R] to reload model.

To write your own model, create new text file and specify path in MODELPATH constant. Write vertexes, vertices and faces of you model under line where it is specified. (see in example model files)
This program so far only excepts rectangelar faces. You can specify polygons color in hex (as showen in example model files) 

Have fun I guess.
